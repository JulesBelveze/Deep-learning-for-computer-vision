# Deep-learning-for-computer-vision
<p>
Repository containing various small projects implemented using PyTorch related to: <b>Deep Learning in Computer Vision</b>.
Each project contains a report that gathers the needed theoritical background and the different implementation's steps.
Code is run on a <i>GeForce GTX TITAN X 12GB</i> GPU.
The results are sometimes relatively bad but the aim here is to understand the main concepts.
